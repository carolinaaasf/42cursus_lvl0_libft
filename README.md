# Libft (42cursus_lvl0)
## Grade: 125/100
### Subject: [here](Extras/en.subject.pdf)

This repository includes all the functions from the libft individual project from 42 cursus (level 0).\n
The goal was to create a library which would include the mostly used C functions, such as strlen, strchr, atoi, etc.
This library will then be useful for future projects, in which it is allowed to use it.
